# Kanvas

<a href="https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/tumblr/kanvas-ios?branch=main"><img src="https://circleci.com/gh/tumblr/kanvas-ios.svg?branch=main&style=svg" alt="Kanvas Build Status"></a>

Kanvas is an [open-source](https://github.com/tumblr/kanvas-ios/blob/main/LICENSE) iOS library for adding effects, drawings, text, stickers, and making GIFs from existing media or the camera.

It is used in the [Tumblr iOS app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tumblr/id305343404) as a camera, media editor, GIF maker, and media posting tool. 

## Setup

Add this to your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'KanvasCamera', :git => 'https://github.com/tumblr/kanvas-ios.git'
```

And run:

```bash
pod install
```

## Usage

Kanvas is mainly two parts: [the Camera](https://github.com/tumblr/kanvas-ios/blob/main/Classes/Camera/CameraController.swift), and [the Editor](https://github.com/tumblr/kanvas-ios/blob/main/Classes/Editor/EditorViewController.swift). Both are just view controllers that you present, and have settings and delegates that help you customize their behavior.

To show the camera:

```swift
let settings = CameraSettings()
let camera = CameraController(settings: settings)
present(camera, animated: true)
```

And to edit existing media, like a video:

```swift
let videoURL = URL(string: "path/to/video.mov")
let settings = CameraSettings()
let editor = EditorViewController.createEditor(for: videoURL, settings: settings)
present(editor, animated: true)
```

Each view controller accepts a [`CameraSettings`](https://github.com/tumblr/kanvas-ios/blob/main/Classes/Settings/CameraSettings.swift) object, which provides fine-grained settings and feature togges. Each view controller also has a `delegate` property for providing your own handlers to creating media, performing editing operations, logging, or really anything else Kanvas can do.

Documentation is lacking at the moment, but contributions are welcome!
